# Data Analysis of Smart Alarm System

In this comprehensive analysis, we are exploring the smart alarm dataset taken from Schneider Electric Inc. which offers a valuable source of insights based on the alarm events recorded in a monitored system. The aim is to extract meaningful insights into the anomalies, patterns, and trends occurring within the dataset by performing machine learning techniques on the data. We aim to uncover critical elements of alarm events, severity levels, and temporal patterns, and by leveraging several analytical methods to have mitigate the alarm occurrences, enhance decision-making processes, and system optimization.
